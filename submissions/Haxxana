## Router Track Mission Week 1


1) Spinning up a router on the testnet
- Router address is: 0xFa52A64eB3a9E24b0cde2FA2d23AE03f1652B924
https://testnet.amarok.connextscan.io/router/0xFa52A64eB3a9E24b0cde2FA2d23AE03f1652B924
- Added on Rinkeby, Kovan, GÃ¶rli Complete.
- Test Bridge Complete.
	
From installing the router, I still encountered some problems due to the incomplete manual. So I've come up with a new, detailed guide that can install and run without problems. Here's an example from my manual https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mmoVazi3hOC6nAqRJMK1VuKPPomi64zv9oxA0nSncFk/edit?usp=sharing
 



2) Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program
- I want to create manual , documentation, code review and scripts for router installation to support new users and easy to upgrade.




3) Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel (1-10 points)
- I've answered the question and created a Docker and Router installation guide in Thai to guide the installer for beginners.
This my guide https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mmoVazi3hOC6nAqRJMK1VuKPPomi64zv9oxA0nSncFk/edit?usp=sharing
